Well latex is the best, if you don't know you have to learn. I really recommendo for docs, order docuemntation, manuals and 
also som presentation. I normmally use latex for all =)


But always is good to share some tips, I write a lot of docs on spanish, and when I learn latex accent wasn't my friends. 

This package I recommend for a simple usage or little article:


```
    %My preference about document
	 
    \textheight=25cm
    \textwidth=16cm
    \topmargin=-2cm
    \oddsidemargin=0cm
    \parindent=0mm



    \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} %this was the solution for spanish speaker
    \usepackage{graphicx}
    \usepackage{enumerate}
    \usepackage{amsmath}
    \usepackage{amssymb}
    \usepackage{textcomp}
    \usepackage{listings}
    \usepackage{tabto}
    \usepackage{hyperref}

```


Enjoy =)
