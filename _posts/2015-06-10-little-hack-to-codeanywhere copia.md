Well I'm fanatic of my green terminal, and for now I use a lot codenaywhere.com.
Is a web IDE online, and you can create devbox, like a vps. Everything works great
but I miss my green console. and I use this simple line of jQuery to edit the font color.
Is cool anyway =)

BTW: Great tool, 

```javascript
jQuery(".terminal-wrap .terminal").attr("style","color:#00FF00");
```
