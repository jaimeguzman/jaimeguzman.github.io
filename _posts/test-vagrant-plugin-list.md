# [Vagrant plugins](http://vagrant-lists.github.io/)

[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) is an amazing tool for managing virtual machines via a simple to use command line interface. With a simple `vagrant up` you can be working in a clean environment based on a standard template.

Vagrant 1.1+ has a plugin infrastructure that allows 3rd party to provide feature additions [Plugins](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/plugins/index.html), and this website is simply a list of plugins.
